   <h1>so... who am i?</h1>
   <p>to clarify, i don't really know how to explain myself fully because i have yet to recall who i am and what i like to do</p>
   <p>but to put things simple, i'm just some random ass pansexual furry guy who lives in honduras (unfortunately, i know) and does quite a lot of internet stuff</p>
   <p>i like to draw thingies (mostly furries and a bit of backgrounds), hang out with friends, and looking at random niche stuff</p>
   <p>i like editing random shit whenever i'm bored</p>
   <p>i like to play games every now and then, probably a fan of shitty pvp games</p>
   <p>i have a questionable silly sense of humor (actually idek what my kinda humor is yet LOL)</p>
   <p>and i like to get to know people if i think they're cool enough, but feel free to reach out still!</p>
   <p>small fact: there's a chance you'll probably see me at random times</p>
   <p>another small fact: yeah i'm that one guy</p><br>
   <p>here's my web button if you wanna add it to your site:</p>

   <h1>my sona!</h1>
   <img src="img/sona.jpg"><br>
   <p>i've had this lil guy for surprisingly 6 years ever since i started creating him, this is his current design as of early 2023</p>
   <p>the reason why i consider this as my "sona" is because i feel like it represents a few things about me, hence why i kept him for so long</p>
   <p>those few things being that i really like the color yellow ever since day one (it's true!), sort of how my personality is like, and to represent my body type irl in a way</p>
   <p>you can find little more information about him on <a href="ocs.html">my ocs page</a></p>
   <p>oh and btw this is his recent ref sheet that i made (january 2025), feel free to draw him if you want, or not, idk you do you</p><br>
