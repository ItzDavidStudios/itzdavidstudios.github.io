   <h1>coming out (again)</h1>
   <p>i've been bisexual for about 4 years and felt comfortable with staying like that, but here's the thing:</p>
   <p>so recently i've been doing some thinking if i might be pansexual for the past few days<br>
   mostly because i like people of any gender and i might actually be attracted to all genders, and also because i think it just feels right for me</p>
   <p>but now after some thinking, i think it's safe to say for me that i am now officially pansexual!<br>
   this might sound a bit corny, but i do hope you guys are fine with this decision, and still accept me as a person<br>
   i will wait and see what it feels like to be pan as time goes on<br>
   (also yes this also means i love frying pans!!!!! /silly)</p>
   <p>idk a way to end this post so uhhh Glorb i guess</p>
