   <h1>might come back to geometry dash after months</h1>
   <p>First, here's a long story short about how I began making levels:</p>
   <p>I first started making levels on GD since 2017-2018, back then, I didn't really know what was I doing with the editor and just messed around with it (no shit it was the first time for me using the editor). You can find my really old levels at my old GD account DavidStudios if you're that curious.<br>
   During 2019-2020, it's where I slowly began improving, with things like decorations, syncing, etc. Those levels I made at that time were at a GDPS I used to be in, (two of them, actually). I prefer not to mention their names. Funnily enough, I made those said levels entirely on a mobile device during that time.<br>
   In case if you're wondering, I don't really play any GDPS anymore, I just prefer to stick to the OG game (cuz i'm cool like that!!!!).<br>
   Anyways, around 2021, or late 2020 is where I actually began improving a whole lot. Unfortunately for whatever god forsaken reason I wasn't able to get those levels done at that time, blame my lack of motivation. However, I did upload a few unfinished levels I made during that time in which I never felt like finishing them. You can find those at my "new" account David1822.<br>
   Around 2022 is where I had actual motivation to finish a level at least <i>once</i>, the first level I finished in question is Vibes (correct me if that isn't the first level i finished please i don't remember lol). Ever since then, I wanted to make more levels and actually finishing them, just rarely, and also because people seemed to like my levels, which makes me happy.<p>
   <p>But now, here's the REAL news:</p>
   <p>On april of this year, I lost my current account (David1822) for... a couple of reasons:<p>
   <p>1) My old laptop was shitty and we had to take it at a repair shop because of it, apparently they had to reset it for some reason that I forgot<br>
      2) I do not remember my password nor my e-mail at <i>all</i> (yes you can laugh at me now)<br>
   <p>Because of that, I "stopped" playing the game for months.</p>
   <p>Though after some thinking, I might come back to this game with a level called Fresh New Start to start a new era for me and this game in some way, and I plan to finish it before new years eve (i hope).<br>
   The downside is, I have to start all over again with a new account as much as it sucks, since I couldn't find any way to get my other account back (DavidStuds is the new account if you wanna send it a friend request).<br>
   Don't expect me to fully come back as I'm still debating, I just said that I <i><b>might</b></i>.</p>
   Apart from all this bullshit, I made an animations page where, of course, you can watch animations that I made throughout the years (they're not very good though). Go search it on the Random Bullshit page.</p>
   <p>i still don't have a way to end this post so thank you for reading all this yappering and good afternoon</p>
