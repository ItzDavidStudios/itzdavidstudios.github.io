<title>coming out (again)</title>
<description><![CDATA[<h1>
	<font color="000000">coming out (again)</font></h1>
<p>
	<font color="000000">i&#39;ve been bisexual for about 4 years and felt comfortable with staying like that, but here&#39;s the thing:</font></p>
<p>
	<font color="000000">so recently i&#39;ve been doing some thinking if i might be pansexual for the past few days<br />
	mostly because i like people of any gender and i might actually be attracted to all genders, and also because i think it just feels right for me</font></p>
<p>
	<font color="000000">but now after some thinking, i think it&#39;s safe to say for me that i am now officially pansexual!<br />
	this might sound a bit corny, but i do hope you guys are fine with this decision, and still accept me as a person<br />
	i will wait and see what it feels like to be pan as time goes on<br />
	(also yes this also means i love frying pans!!!!! /silly)</font></p>
<p>
	<font color="000000">idk a way to end this post so uhhh Glorb i guess</font></p>

	you can now submit your art for me on the fanart page, either via e-mail or one of my contacts</font></p>
<p>
	<font color="000000">you can now subscribe to RSS feeds on certain pages<br />
	if you don&#39;t know what RSS is and how to &quot;subscribe&quot; to feeds, go to the home page and you&#39;ll see smth about feeds n shit at the bottom, then click on that lil tutorial i made</font></p>
<p>
	<font color="000000">and finally, i changed the meta descriptions and titles (whatever the fuck you call them) for every page,<br />

<title>new website overhaul!</title>
<description><![CDATA[<h1>
	<font color="000000">new website overhaul!</font></h1>
<p>
	<font color="000000">hello and welcome to the new web design!!</font></p>
<p>
	<font color="000000">now there&#39;s:<br />
	1) NEW WEB DESIGN!!!<br />
	2) PAGES ARE A LOT MORE FORMAL THAN BEFORE!!!<br />
	3) REMOVED ALL THE USELESS SHIT FROM HERE!!!<br />
	4) SOME NEW PAGES!!!<br />
	5) GOODBYE DAVID DASH YOU WILL BE MISSED.</font></p>
<p>
	<font color="000000">main reason i decided to change everything is because the old design looked shitty and there was some stuff that were pointless<br />
	this new design may not be amazing, but it&#39;s definitely an improvement compared to the last one lol<br />
	thank you for coming, i don&#39;t really have much to say xd<br />
	hope y&#39;all like this new overhaul tho!</font></p>
