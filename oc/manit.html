   <h2>biography</h2>
   <p>Manitowoc is a blue fox (not to be confused with <a href="poi.html">Poi</a>, who oddly enough has a similar design). He wears some black goggles which are always raised (he likes it that way), a black hoodie with a text that says "RAWR!" and a picture of a furry's head, and some dolphin shorts, as well as a armband with the bisexual flag on it. Almost on a daily basis, he goes to fight with other people on a so called "Item Asylum", which a lot of people from there seem to hate him, but Manitowoc himself doesn't mind (he's cool like that). Also he's a god gamer (he WILL destroy you in any game, no really!). Also he loves the 2000s and 2010s nostalgia as well as emo/scene type stuff.</p><br>
   <p><i>Fun fact: Manitowoc is also my <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/2230447480/profile">Roblox</a> avatar!</i></p>
