   <h1><font color="FFFFFF">Guidelines Before Submitting your Fanart</h1>
   <h3><i>(because common sense apparently doesn't exist)</i></h3><br>
   <p>Please follow the guidelines below before submitting your art, there aren't a lot, so no worries</p>

   <h2>1) Always use the template and it's means</h2>
   <p>This is the template, which is automatically generated in your e-mail inbox, and what they mean:</p>
   <p>Title: (however you want to title your art)<br>
   Your username: (it's obvious)<br>
   Any socials you have (including your own site: (this is optional)</p>
   <p>(attach your art, important)
   <p>Though, if you want to stay anonymous, you can simply leave the username input in blank<br>
   You can change the subject of your e-mail to whatever you like, I don't mind</p>

   <h2>2) Do NOT send me NSFW drawings of my characters</h2>
   <p>The thing is, I prefer to keep this website a safe space (if that makes sense) and keeping away any NSFW stuff in it, suggestive drawings of my characters are fine though<br>
   Speaking of which, make sure to point out on your e-mail if your drawing is suggestive or not, but this is purely optional, I guess</p>

   <h2>3) Any kind of work is great, really!</h2>
   <p>Sketches, paintings, etc. are fine for me, hell even joke-ish drawings are acceptable. What can I say? Art is art!</font></p>
